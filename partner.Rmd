1. Partner name is John King github username for him is JMichKing.


2. The commit ID is 8513a9064785d4309574864591cd6a0b5dee3049 and it is the first and only commit that uploads the homework 1 file to github.


3. I wasn't able to knit his .Rmd file until I had added in the png file that he used for his homework but once I added that I was good to go. 

4. I didn't really run into any problems for this lab but it helps being a senior in SE and having three different internships worth of work experience.
